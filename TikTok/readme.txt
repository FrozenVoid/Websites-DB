TikTok is essentially Orwell's Prolefeed
with Chinese characteristics.
TikTok provides an endless stream of 
videos and lets and algorithm gauge engagement
with specific tags from user interest, measured
from time spent on video tagged/captioned as x. 
Videos are designed to be short and attention-grabbing
as all content competes for reflexive-associative
 engagement, similar to meme culture.
