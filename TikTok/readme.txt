TikTok is essentially Orwell's Prolefeed
with Chinese characteristics.
TikTok provides an endless stream of 
videos and lets an algorithm gauge engagement
with specific tags from amount of user interest. 
Videos are designed to be short and attention-grabbing
as all content competes for reflexive-associative
 engagement, similar to meme culture.
