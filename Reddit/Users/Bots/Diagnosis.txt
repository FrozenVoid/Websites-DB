Bots cannot hide their purpose:
Every bot is focused single-mindendly
at one topic which it will 
promote at expense of everything
else: a bot will not have diverse
interests.

Early posts: Early posts of
bought or manually operated accounts will sound genuine
and abruptly turn artificial.
"manually operated" is often 
outsourced to third-world countries.

Karma gathering:
Some bots
will try to gather karma with
automated reposts or links to
latest articles(e.g. rss newsfeeds)
in high-traffic subreddits
to generate initial karma enabling
access and influence(redditors
equate karma with social power).
These are unoriginal reposts of
some content that already exists,
as bots cannot produce anything
original(outside of neural
network commentary trained on
subreddits) as e.g. self-posts.




Comments:
Bots will not engage in discussion
as it will risk exposing the bot
operation, instead multiple bots
will monitor a subreddit comment
stream and use their numbers for
cheap social pressure tactics to
overwhelm human opposition:
examining any of the bots behavior will
reveals their exclusive attachment
to single topic while having no
human-scale interests.

Neural network dependence:
Many bots will train
on specific subreddits to imitate
their culture and accepted
content format to better promote
the bot-operator agenda,however
the artificial nature of filler
content and biased 'inserts' will
contrast as bots lack genuine
understanding of appropriate sentences:
e.g.a paragraph of neutral content
imitating a subreddit average poster,
will contain alien inclusion of some
words that make little sense outside
the sentence,clashing with overall
content or being contradictory to 
character of account(bot don't have
a fixed character): e.g. a NN-bot
will not hesitate adopting a different
persona for every post, as long
as it stays on one topic.
