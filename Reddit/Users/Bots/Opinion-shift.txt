Bots in large numbers can sway
opinions: search engine space and
Reddit's social influence are
valuable virtual real estate,
which attracts political and 
commercial interest in its control.

Their tactics:
1.Integration: bots posts NN-generated
drivel trained on target subreddit.
This builds artificial reputation
judge by karma, with bots upvoting
each others comments and posts.
The content at this stage is 
aligned with prevailing opinion.

2.Shift: bots beging changing the
usual content to insert specific
 position that is neither contrary
but neither mainstream with human
posters. This stage progresses 
for weeks to saturate subreddit
with alternative positions, one
of which is the new agenda.
(however some bots will pretend
to stay in 'mildly contrarian' 
phase until very late takeover to
present an image of genuine shift)

3.Escalation: bots gradually
shifts to more extreme position
that is contrary to original 
mainstream subreddit.
At this point subreddit humans
will begins massive arguments
and debates which bots will
avoid to gain an illusory 
'silent acceptance': their side
of argument will be only provided
within top-level comments and
never resort to deeper discussion.

4.Mass downvoting: bots will
downvote specific topics/comments
en masse to give impression that
subreddit culture changed:
actual goal is supression of
dissent
Many regulars leave at this point.
Moderator changes are common at
this point, as shills and bot
operators gain artificial influence.

5.Bot content promotion:
As bots assume a dominant position
the content that is upvoted becomes
the target: upvoting changes
to shift newcomers opinion to 
articles/posts aligned with 
new agenda: biased and fixed
focus on single topic.
The subreddit is 
finally subverted as newcomers
adopt 'bot culture' that is a faint
echo of early subreddit content
mixed with agenda promotion.
