Shills are professional opinion
shifters that work with bots
(for karma) and even use 
hybrid accounts(e.g. bot posts, human
comments) to maximize effect.

Recognizing shills:
Shills operate to promote
a single 'opinion form',
however (unlike bots) they
are not bound to it: they
will posts neutral content
or scraped newsfeed links for
filler and karma.

Shills utilize karma boosting from
bots, often disproportionate to
their visibility(e.g. early
large karma, low-traffic but high
karma comment) to occupy top
spots in subreddits and comment
threads.

Shills often use multiple
 accounts: they can take over
 bots or bought accounts if 
 the situation calls for it:
Often a subreddit post will
contain a similar reply from
another account that 'supports' the shill by 
agreeing or expanding the post,
this increases engagement by
creating illusion of 'crowd opinion',
that shills use to shift topic
focus and direct to their promoted 
agenda.


Rapid content generation:
Neural network text generation
is now being done for seed 
content, as shills outsource
'bulk generation' to AI:
the shill only checks the text
for consistency and style.
GPT-3 type networks can be
trained on specific prompt,
by feeding an growing series
of sentences finished by AI:
e.g. prompt response first
paragraph used to generated
 second, then third(until
 NN starts contradicting itself).
