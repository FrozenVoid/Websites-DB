The posting of content in
high-density subreddit is risky,
as culture of 'abudance of content'
in such subreddit has grown to
be extremely critical and judging,
making smaller subreddit a much
easier target for content introduction:
as smaller subreddit value any
content, allowing it later to be
crossposted/reposted as 'established
 content' by virtue of being accepted
 in some parts of reddit:
 This 'Content Aversion' is a form
 of cultural antipathy for mainstream
 content that dominates the reddit
 algorithm: cookie cutter, clean and
 predictable flow of consumer and
 advertiser-friendly posts create
 a 'memetic allergy' that triggers 
 redditors to reject content as too
 mainstream, lacking originality or novelty,
 even if such content is completely
 original as content fatigue sets in:
 these redditors form a block of
 novelty-seeking voting power that
 downvotes 'clean' content and 
 promotes 'fringe' content,
 in vain hope of replacing stale
 cultural mainstream patterns that
 dominate with 'fresh, controversial'
 replacements(that will eventually
 get 'too mainstream'/'common reposts')
 
 
 Originality vs Content-Aversion:
 The average reddit addict does
 not judge originality, only the 
 similarity/novelty within mainstream]
 reddit culture. Their reactions for
 encountering original content can
 be summarized in two paths:
 
 A.If the context is too controversial
 or does not integrate within the mainsteam
 flow of culture, it is rejected
 until it becomes similar(but novel) enough
 to cultural layer acceptable
 on reddit.
 
 B.If the content is fringe, controversial
 or novel, but can be integrated into
 mainstream consumer culture, it
 is promoted until reposts make it mainstream:
 initial similarity of 'novel' content
 guarantees speedy adoption and speedy demise,
 while low-similarity(to mainstream cultural layer)
 reduces speed of adoption but increases
 cultural timeframe of 'novelty'.
