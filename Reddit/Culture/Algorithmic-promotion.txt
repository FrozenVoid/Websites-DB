 Reddit has a certain culture
 layer that it promotes by 
 algorithmic means:
 Usually it boosts marginalized/
 progressive/controversial viewpoints on popular
 subreddits and downranks 
 viewpoints/subreddits that clash
 with general Reddit crowd opinion
 as decided by admins: the cultural
 context is narrowing each year
 to resrict more subreddits as 
 reddit reach in social media grows,
 as its administration power over
 the communities and their influence
 is refined by technical means:i.e.
 alteration of reddit software to
 promote and demote specific content.
 
 Controversial viewpoints:
 Reddit rides the balance between
 being an outrage machine and
 community cohesion, that make
 some controversial viewpoints/subreddits/users
  artificially promoted until
  they threaten advertising profits or
 if a controversy threatens 
 social cohesion of entire reddit
 community or subverts some
unwritten social contract that
admins imagine themselves in, the
culture is repressed, even if its
harmless in retrospect: the culture
of administration and reddit at large
eventually aligns and 'allowed'
window of expression is explicitly
reduced by new rules and regulations,
with attempts to reintroduce a banned
subreddit viewed as assault on
reddit's mainstream culture.

Bypassing 'reddit cultural limits':
Visual media isn't understood well
by the reddit scanning only 
titles(which can be very vague)
,comment text and likely OCR of
image macro text(popular posts
are a small fraction of all images), which would fail
in purely visual content such
as videos posted on reddit.

User tracking:
Reddit classifies user's culture
and their alignment to mainstream
reddit consumer culture as a risk
factor: this is taken from user
posts and subscriptions to build
a picture of 'subreddit culture'
as linked to other parts of reddit,
