YouTube(lit. your TV(tube)) is the largest video
streaming and video file distribution website 
on the internet, run through Google cloud.
The bandwidth used by YouTube represents a huge
chunk of internet use by most countries.

The growth of YouTube largely stems from clever 
reccomendation algorithm that suggests similar 
videos, though it is known to censor and downrank
anything controversial: the algorithm is conservative
in generating the user homepage, preferring to 
suggest familiar/popular content, with discovery
occuring mostly through Mix playlists,
Side panel reccomendations(on video) and Trending 
pages(sometimes inserted at homepage).

YouTube functionally adopted a second 'Shorts'
format for mobile content discovery, which
puts vertical videos(usually uploaded via mobile apps)
in an infinite stream(resembling TikTok feed) inside
the YT page interface: it operates by sensing disinterest
in 'skipped' videos as downranking similar content
and suggests videos from pool of accounts where user
has interest in(watch/like).
